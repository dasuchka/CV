    <h2>ABOUT MYSELF</h2>
    <p>I'm studying in Belarusian state university at the Department of energy physics.
        Some of my favourite subjects are Physics of solid state, Basics of solid state electronics,
        Theoretical mechanics and Programming and mathematical modeling of physical processes.
        During my studies, i programmed in Python, Delphi and JavaScript, used such packages as Matlab, Wolfram Mathematica, SolidWorks and Ansys.
        The topic of my thesis is connected with modeling of cycles of steam turbine plants with the help of Matlab.
        It will be an app which will display graphics describing steam transformation.</p>
    <p>I'm very positive, purposeful, sociable person who can learn fast. I like think and ask questions.
        Ready to study new and work hard to achieve goals.
        If i can't understand or do something i will spend a lot of time until everything works out.
        I'm responsible, i will try to make task or work as well as it's possible. Since one of my hobbies is drawing, i have
        a good imagination of the processes.
        Like art, traveling and sport.</p>
